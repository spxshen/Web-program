			I was born in 1989 in a not very small city called Xi'an, and now I am a graduate student in Stevens, pursuiting the master degree in Computer Since. Not a programming guy, but like to taking programming courses, such as CS546 Web Programming.

			Talking about my favorite song, I quite like the sony I'm listening now, the name is "Roses and Gold" by Robin Jackson. You really should try it.

			Hobbies? How about eating foods? Yes, that's it. There is no thing could satisfy me more than eating delicious foods.
