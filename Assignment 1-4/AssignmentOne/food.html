	<h1>Hello there,</h1>
	<h2>These are the first four restaurants I've found on a misery website called Yelp, please don't tell anyone. But if you do, please ask them not to tell anyone else.</h2>

			<h3>Andrea Salumeria </h3>

				Apt 3,
				Jersey City, NJ 07307
			</address>
			<aside>
				Straight up.  Don't sleep on this place.  It's 5 strong stars, and if you like high quality meat and cheese super-stacked sandwiches, THIS IS IT.  They do it with true Italian TLC.

			<h3>Rizzo Bakery </h3>
			<address>
				208 Central Ave
				Jersey City, NJ 07307
			</address>
			<aside>
				I've been dreaming about the Rizzo slice since my last time there. $2.00 for a slice that is possibly bigger than my face. My husband and I had a slice each and split a third. I was full for hours after! I haven't done take out but I can't imagine waiting to eat such amazing pizza. Do yourself a favor and go ASAP.

			<h3>Honey Bakery</h3>
			<address>
				673 Bergen Ave
				Jersey City, NJ 07304
			</address>
			<aside>
				I got food from here twice -  spicy lamb sandwich is awesome,  I can't recommend it enough. It's flavorful,  juicy and has just the right amount of spiciness. I like that there is a bit of pepper,  mushroom in the sandwich to add to the flavor and texture.
